## Solving a Battleship Board Game as an Optimization Problem

A genetic algorithm is a prime example of technology imitating nature to solve complex problems, in this case, by adopting the concept of natural selection in an evolutionary algorithm. Genetic algorithms, introduced in 1960 by John Holland, extend Alan Turing’s concept of a “learning machine” and are best-suited for solving optimization problems such as the traveling salesman.

To intuitively understand the practical implementation and fundamental requirements for employing genetic algorithms, we can set up a toy problem and solve the board of the classic guessing game, Battleship, first released by Milton Bradley in 1967. But rather than calling a sequence of individual shots, let’s ask our genetic algorithm to make a series of guesses of the entire board.

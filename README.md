SOLVING A BATTLESHIP BOARD GAME AS AN OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM

A genetic algorithm is a prime example of technology imitating nature to solve complex problems, in this case, by adopting the concept of natural selection in an evolutionary algorithm. Genetic algorithms, introduced in 1960 by John Holland, extend Alan Turing’s concept of a “learning machine” and are best-suited for solving optimization problems such as the traveling salesman.

To intuitively understand the practical implementation and fundamental requirements for employing genetic algorithms, we can set up a toy problem and solve the board of the classic guessing game, Battleship, first released by Milton Bradley in 1967. But rather than calling a sequence of individual shots, let’s ask our genetic algorithm to make a series of guesses of the entire board.

- [x] **Random Board Generator for Battleship Game**<br>
Graphical and binary representation of Battleship board with 5 ships occupying 17 squares
- [x] **Implementation of Genetic Algorithm**<br>
Iterative solver that generates candidate solutions of an entire board  of a random Battleship game and converges to the genetic solution
- [x] **Genetic Selector: Elitism**<br>
The fittest chromosomes from the former generation that are selected to be parents of all of the chromosomes in a new generation.
- [x] **Genetic Operator: Crossover**<br>
Two chromosomes can be spliced at a random crossover gene and recombined to create two children, sharing gene chains from both parents.
- [x] **Genetic Operator: Mutation**<br>
Random genes of one chromosome can be inverted with bit flips to create a single child that exhibits a small genetic variation from its parent.

**[The Battleship Module](/src/battleship.py)**

* Random board generator for Battleship game
  1. Position the head of the ship with a random two-dimensional tuple.
  2. Orient the heading of the ship with a random cardinal direction.
  3. Locate the tail of the ship based on its head position, direction and length.
  4. Check that the tail of the ship remains within the boundaries of the board.
  5. Check that the ship does not overlap with any previously positioned ships.
  6. Repeat the process if the ship fails either of the two assertion tests.
* Genetic representation of the board solution as binary list
* Fitness function evaluator of a candidate solution based on accuracy
